      <h2>Our Story</h2>
     <p> My Baking Recipes began as a handwritten recipe book in my grandmother's kitchen. 
       What started as a passion for Saturday morning cookies has now grown into a digital collection of beloved bakes and sweet surprises. </p>
      <p> Each recipe is tested with love, sprinkled with tradition, and shared in the hopes of adding a little joy to your day. Whether you're an expert or a first-time baker, you're welcome here. </p> 
      <p>Thank you for stopping by — let's bake something beautiful together!</p>
